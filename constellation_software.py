    championing broad processes like lean six sigma or the Pareto principle and applying them to a relatively\

    Engagement and morale metrics are not something we track from head office. Implicit in the question, is\
    the assumption that superior employee engagement and morale, coupled with head office supervision,\
    will lead to better company performance.\
    I noticed employee engagement as a topic a couple of months ago when one of our groups hired a speaker\
    to talk about it at their off-site meeting. A bit of casual Googling showed me that employee engagement\
    was starting to get buzz in the business press and Amazon had a slew of books on the topic by general\
    purpose business gurus (“GPBG”). I’m suspicious of GPBG’s, so I started digging for relevant scholarly\
    research. A resource that I like is the Centre for Evidence Based Management’s library website, where\
    you can search for systematic reviews and meta analyses ( http://cebma-library.org/ ). Normal humans\
    don’t have the time and/or skills to wade through 1000’s of research papers to generate informed\
    opinions. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses do a lot of the work for us.")
    
    st.write("The consistent criticisms of employee engagement as a cause of business unit performance seemed to be\
    three-fold: employee engagement is a fuzzily defined concept, it isn’t clear that it causes performance\
    (although a correlated concept, job satisfaction, does appear to be a cause performance), and there are a\
    large number of other factors that have statistically significant effects upon performance, the most\
    compelling of which is an employee’s satisfaction with their supervisor.")

    st.write("One of the fundamental beliefs at CSI, is that autonomy motivates people, and bureaucracy does the\
    opposite, so we try to do as many of the important monitoring tasks with as light a touch as possible. I\
    notice CSI managers who can’t retain good subordinates. This isn’t data provided by a head office\
    supervisory system and doesn’t involve any bureaucracy… just personal awareness. I think our Operating\
    Group Managers and Portfolio Managers monitor turnover similarly. This practice seems more likely to\
    improve performance with less effort than tracking engagement and morale metrics.")
    
    st.write("And the first question: What does CSI do to attract, retain and motivate employees?\
    Our internal recruiters use all the normal methods to attract new employees: job boards, search\
    consultants, LinkedIn, referral fees for current employees who generate successful candidates, etc.\
    Attracting employees works best for me via my network. I get better folks who tend to stay. Retaining\
    employees seems to require big doses of opportunity and occasional empathy: Opportunity because the\
    best employees want more… more knowledge, more money, more responsibility, and more autonomy. Empathy\
    because they are pushing their limits and sometimes crack. Motivation seems to come from the\
    team and the task. If employees work with people that they respect on tasks that are important, then\
    finding the motivation isn’t a problem.")

    even if the investments have very different risk profiles. I encourage our folks to use the MECE method\

    depend upon a manager's subjective assessment of a subordinate, there's a temptation for the\
    subordinate to optimise their bonus by agreeing with the boss. Formulas also get questions of fairness\
    into the open since the OG managers know the components and relative weightings in the formula and\
    can debate their appropriateness. Not all of our OG managers agree with a formulaic approach to\
    incentive comp… some feel that they have built enough mutual trust between themselves and their direct\

    manager would receive a high bonus. Compare that to an extremely hard working OG manager who is\
    running a cyclical business that is struggling in absolute terms, but doing well compared to its industry\
    peers. An example of the latter would be our Homebuilding OG in '08 and '09, when 80% of their prior\
    years' bonuses were vapourised by the downturn in the homebuilding industry.")

    what it should be, then we believe that their incentive should reflect that, irrespective of the effort they\
    are expending to manage their portfolio. Similarly, if the manager has a portfolio of great businesses that\
    'run themselves' and the manager has trained and promoted a competent and inspiring team, then I have\
    no problem with them reaping the incentives provided by the bonus formula. However, if either manager\
    is unethical, is not respected by their subordinates, or is trading off long-term success for short-term\
    profits to optimise bonus at the expense of long-term shareholder value, then we will replace them.")

    st.write("In my last Letter to Shareholders dated April 20, 2018, I wrote about the pros and cons of using the growth in\
    Adjusted net income (“ANI”) per share versus cash flow from operations ('CFO') per share as indicators of the\
    increase in CSI's economic value. Neither metric is ideal.\
    Too often managers and shareholders unquestioningly accept ANI as the equivalent of earnings available to\
    shareholders. Regulators require reconciliations of ANI to net income to highlight the difference, but these\
    reconciliations often get short shrift. CFO doesn’t distinguish well between the return on capital and the return of capital.\
    In CSI's reconciliation of ANI and Adjusted EBITA to net income the largest item is the amortisation of intangible\
    assets. Clearly some of this amortisation represents an actual decrease in the economic value of the related\
    underlying intangible assets. Our appreciating intangible assets have more than offset depreciating intangible assets\
    to date, so I didn't fret about adding back the entire amount when calculating ANI. That will not always be the case.\
    We have literally thousands of purchased products and the associated customer relationships. Many of these\
    intangible assets are regularly maintained, enhanced and extended. A few deteriorate - some due to irrational\
    competitors, some due to poor management and some due to shrinkage in the underlying vertical. The vast majority\
    of CSI's economic value resides in our ability to acquire and manage these intangible assets. I can guarantee that\
    indiscriminately adding back amortisation to create a proxy for earnings available to shareholders will eventually\
    be misleading. I'd much rather our shareholders focused on the free cash flow that is produced each year and the\
    trend in that free cash flow.")
    st.write("We will no longer report ANI and Adjusted EBITA. We will focus instead on IFRS sanctioned measures of\
    profitability (i.e. net income) and cashflow (i.e. net cashflow from operations) in our MD&A, and will add FCFA2S\
    as our only non-IFRS metric.")
    st.write("We calculate FCFA2S by taking net cash flow from operating activities per IFRS, subtracting the amounts that we\
    spend on fixed assets and on servicing the capital we have sourced from other stakeholders (e.g. debt providers,\
    lease providers, minority shareholders), and then adding interest and dividends earned on investments. The\
    remaining FCFA2S is the uncommitted cashflow available to CSI's shareholders if we made no further acquisitions,\
    nor repaid our other capital-providing stakeholders.")
    st.write("There has been grumbling from some of CSI's directors and finance staff that I'm creating much ado about nothing…\
    that FCFA2S is very similar to ANI, so why make the change? Partly, it’s the name. ANI implies income. When\
    we buy a company that we expect to consistently shrink, then the ANI for that business is actually a combination\
    of return on capital and return of capital. The name implies otherwise.")
    st.write("I did like the fact that ANI, unlike CFO, was net of the cost of servicing the capital provided by other stakeholders\
    (e.g. interest on debt, dividends on preferred stock, and lease payments). The deductions from CFO that we've made\
    to create FCFA2S reflect this cost. This may become an increasingly important adjustment if we do more partnering\
    with other investors and operators or create spin-out businesses.")
    st.write("FCFA2S captures changes in working capital, while ANI did not. If venture-backed competitors use their balance\

    customers signing a 5 year subscription.")

    Both metrics look at return on investment. ROIC is the return on the shareholders’ investment and\
    EBITA Return is the return on all capital. In the former, financial leverage plays a role. In the latter only\
    the operating efficiency with which all net assets are used is reflected, irrespective of whether those assets\
    are financed with debt or shareholders’ investment.")

    source for each HPC, they averaged a respectable 21% EBITA Return. Subsequently their returns\
    experienced a period of dramatic improvement as they refined their operating methods and philosophies.\
    These operating methods varied, but generally involved techniques for the detailed measurement of\
    business processes coupled with relentless incremental improvement. At some of the HPCs the methods\
    are applied with a zeal that makes me a bit uncomfortable. It’s hard to argue with results. The average\
    peak EBITA Return for the HPCs was 46%, and on average it took them 6 years from the start of our\
    measurement period to achieve those peak returns.")

    upon acquisition programs. They acquired businesses similar to their own - i.e. asset light business with\
    good barriers to entry and a history of positive organic growth. They paid significant premiums to book\
    value for the acquisitions. The initial EBITA Return in each of the acquired businesses would have been\
    modest because of the high purchase prices, but organic growth required little investment in tangible\
    assets so returns would have subsequently climbed. In many instances the acquired businesses were not\
    run optimally prior to acquisition, and the HPCs were able to apply their business practices to further\
    improve returns.")

    st.write("Financial leverage is a tool that can have a profound impact on ROIC. Some HPCs have whittled down\
    Invested Capital as a percent of Total Capital by borrowing to pay dividends, repurchase shares, and/or\
    make acquisitions. This has helped them generate higher ROIC’s. One of the HPCs has returned their\
    entire Invested Capital to shareholders, and hence generates an infinite ROIC. If covenant-free long tenured\
    debt is available at a lower after tax cost than equity, then this kind of capital structure is\
    attractive.")

    correlation. If you are really striving to see a relationship, you might argue that our best and our worst\
    IRR’s are both associated with low post-acquisition organic growth. Based on the data, there are much\
    more obvious drivers of IRR than OGr. For instance, Revenue multiple paid (lower purchase price\
    multiples are better - no revelation there), and post-acquisition EBITA margin (fatter margin acquisitions\
    tend to generate better IRR’s – somewhat intuitive, but needs further work).")

    acquisitions slowed dramatically, and Initiative spending dropped. Faced with the prospect of new\
    owners intent on changing the bonus program and borrowing mountains of debt to acquire the business,\

    this is a function of my experience with small high performance teams when I was a venture capitalist, and\
    partly it is a function of seeing that most vertical markets have several viable competitors who exhibit little\
    correlation between their profitability and relative scale. Some of our Operating Group GM’s agree with\
    me, while others are less convinced. There are a number of implications if you share my view: We should\
    a) regularly divide our largest business units into smaller, more focused business units unless there is an\
