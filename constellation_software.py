    to our employee shareholders has cost them literally billions of dollars. The experience has made us very\
    conscious of the value of our shares. We didn’t issue any shares when we went public. We haven’t issued\

    Engagement and morale metrics are not something we track from head office. Implicit in the question, is\
    the assumption that superior employee engagement and morale, coupled with head office supervision,\
    will lead to better company performance.\
    I noticed employee engagement as a topic a couple of months ago when one of our groups hired a speaker\
    to talk about it at their off-site meeting. A bit of casual Googling showed me that employee engagement\
    was starting to get buzz in the business press and Amazon had a slew of books on the topic by general\
    purpose business gurus (“GPBG”). I’m suspicious of GPBG’s, so I started digging for relevant scholarly\
    research. A resource that I like is the Centre for Evidence Based Management’s library website, where\
    you can search for systematic reviews and meta analyses ( http://cebma-library.org/ ). Normal humans\
    don’t have the time and/or skills to wade through 1000’s of research papers to generate informed\
    opinions. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses do a lot of the work for us.")
    
    st.write("The consistent criticisms of employee engagement as a cause of business unit performance seemed to be\
    three-fold: employee engagement is a fuzzily defined concept, it isn’t clear that it causes performance\

    large number of other factors that have statistically significant effects upon performance, the most\
    compelling of which is an employee’s satisfaction with their supervisor.")

    st.write("One of the fundamental beliefs at CSI, is that autonomy motivates people, and bureaucracy does the\
    opposite, so we try to do as many of the important monitoring tasks with as light a touch as possible. I\
    notice CSI managers who can’t retain good subordinates. This isn’t data provided by a head office\
    supervisory system and doesn’t involve any bureaucracy… just personal awareness. I think our Operating\
    Group Managers and Portfolio Managers monitor turnover similarly. This practice seems more likely to\
    improve performance with less effort than tracking engagement and morale metrics.")
    
    st.write("And the first question: What does CSI do to attract, retain and motivate employees?\
    Our internal recruiters use all the normal methods to attract new employees: job boards, search\
    consultants, LinkedIn, referral fees for current employees who generate successful candidates, etc.\
    Attracting employees works best for me via my network. I get better folks who tend to stay. Retaining\
    employees seems to require big doses of opportunity and occasional empathy: Opportunity because the\
    best employees want more… more knowledge, more money, more responsibility, and more autonomy. Empathy\
    because they are pushing their limits and sometimes crack. Motivation seems to come from the\
    team and the task. If employees work with people that they respect on tasks that are important, then\
    finding the motivation isn’t a problem.")

    even if the investments have very different risk profiles. I encourage our folks to use the MECE method\

    experiments (if the cost/benefit of our experiments can be justified), case studies, and experts to help me\

    a standard than prospectus disclosures. That strikes me as legally correct but unlikely to be the observed\

with st.expander('Oct 2019 Q&A: Note to Shareholders regarding non-IFRS Measure'):
    st.write("In my last Letter to Shareholders dated April 20, 2018, I wrote about the pros and cons of using the growth in\
    Adjusted net income (“ANI”) per share versus cash flow from operations ('CFO') per share as indicators of the\
    increase in CSI's economic value. Neither metric is ideal.\
    Too often managers and shareholders unquestioningly accept ANI as the equivalent of earnings available to\
    shareholders. Regulators require reconciliations of ANI to net income to highlight the difference, but these\
    reconciliations often get short shrift. CFO doesn’t distinguish well between the return on capital and the return of capital.\
    In CSI's reconciliation of ANI and Adjusted EBITA to net income the largest item is the amortisation of intangible\
    assets. Clearly some of this amortisation represents an actual decrease in the economic value of the related\
    underlying intangible assets. Our appreciating intangible assets have more than offset depreciating intangible assets\
    to date, so I didn't fret about adding back the entire amount when calculating ANI. That will not always be the case.\
    We have literally thousands of purchased products and the associated customer relationships. Many of these\
    intangible assets are regularly maintained, enhanced and extended. A few deteriorate - some due to irrational\
    competitors, some due to poor management and some due to shrinkage in the underlying vertical. The vast majority\
    of CSI's economic value resides in our ability to acquire and manage these intangible assets. I can guarantee that\
    indiscriminately adding back amortisation to create a proxy for earnings available to shareholders will eventually\
    be misleading. I'd much rather our shareholders focused on the free cash flow that is produced each year and the\
    trend in that free cash flow.")
    st.write("We will no longer report ANI and Adjusted EBITA. We will focus instead on IFRS sanctioned measures of\
    profitability (i.e. net income) and cashflow (i.e. net cashflow from operations) in our MD&A, and will add FCFA2S\
    as our only non-IFRS metric.")

    spend on fixed assets and on servicing the capital we have sourced from other stakeholders (e.g. debt providers,\
    lease providers, minority shareholders), and then adding interest and dividends earned on investments. The\
    remaining FCFA2S is the uncommitted cashflow available to CSI's shareholders if we made no further acquisitions,\
    nor repaid our other capital-providing stakeholders.")
    st.write("There has been grumbling from some of CSI's directors and finance staff that I'm creating much ado about nothing…\
    that FCFA2S is very similar to ANI, so why make the change? Partly, it’s the name. ANI implies income. When\
    we buy a company that we expect to consistently shrink, then the ANI for that business is actually a combination\
    of return on capital and return of capital. The name implies otherwise.")
    st.write("I did like the fact that ANI, unlike CFO, was net of the cost of servicing the capital provided by other stakeholders\
    (e.g. interest on debt, dividends on preferred stock, and lease payments). The deductions from CFO that we've made\

    following the company from afar in 2005.I’m\
    sorry I didn’t reach out to some of the ITW employees and ex-employees until 2015. When I did talk\
    with one of the senior managers, he said (I’m paraphrasing) “Something wonderful happens when you\
    spin off a new business unit.” … “With a clean sheet of paper, the leader only takes those he needs. They\
    set up in an open office with good communication and no overheads. They cover for each other. They\
    leave all the bureaucracy and the crap behind”. I did record a couple of verbatim quotes from that\
    conversation: 'Don't share sales, R&D, HR, etc. because the accountants never get the allocations right\
    and the business units always treat the allocated costs as outside their control', and 'When you get big\
    you lose entrepreneurship'")

    st.write("I don’t want to give you the impression that the 'human-scale' BU idea is a universally accepted doctrine\
    in our ranks. For that, I suspect we’d need more compelling data. However, we have been successfully\
    experimenting with the concept for a long time.Harris has very successfully acquired multiple BU's in the same industry\
    and run them independently rather than combining them into one BU. Both tactics forego obvious and\
    easily obtainable benefits from economies of scale. We think we get something valuable when we\
    constrain BU headcount, but it isn’t a panacea for all of our organic growth challenges.")
    
    st.write("This sort of career path obviously worked for our current Operating Group Managers, who all either came\
    up through the ranks or joined us via an acquisition. I believe that attracting, developing, and keeping\
    that sort of talent, is the internal execution issue that poses the greatest threat to our continued success.")
    st.write("Some businesses get their unique advantage from government-granted monopolies, some from natural\
        resources, some from large patent portfolios, and some from enormous fixed assets. CSI doesn’t have\
        these advantages. Our employees, and the customer relationships that those employees have built and\
        fostered over many years, provide our competitive advantage.")
