    st.write("Some of our businesses serve shrinking\
    verticals or those that are otherwise troubled, so we don’t necessarily expect strong organic growth from\
    them. We do expect each business unit (“BU”) to provide constantly evolving software and systems that\
    help their clients refine and strengthen their businesses, even in the face of industry headwinds.")
    st.write("The growth in FCF per share metric\
    isn’t very sensitive to debt and cash, but right now our net cash is not significant. Jamal’s preferred\
    measure of our progress is the growth in ANI per share. It is less volatile than FCF per share (because the\
    variance in net working capital largely washes out over the long run), and it does adjust for the portion of\
    ANI that should accrue to minority shareholders.")
    st.write("If I had to stake my reputation on one of those as the best proxy for the annual increase in intrinsic value, I\
    would go with the increase in FCF per share. Jamal may yet argue me around to the growth in ANI per\
    share. Keep in mind that you don’t need to use any single metric to judge our performance. Enterprising\
    long-term investors will look at many metrics.")
    st.write("I am suspicious of 'vision'. Long-term studies suggest that the underlying predictions or assumptions for\
    visions are nearly always impractically vague or outright wrong (see Tetlock’s “Superforecasting”). I am\
    not much happier with the term 'mission'. It feels too heavily freighted with overtones of hierarchy and\
    unquestioning compliance. I prefer to talk about Constellation's objective. Our objective is to be a great\
    perpetual owner of VMS businesses. We like VMS businesses because they are asset-light, have robust\
    moats, and attract the sort of managers and employees with whom we enjoy working. ")
    st.write("One day Constellation may find that VMS businesses are too expensive to rationally acquire. If that\
    happens, I hope we'll have had the foresight and luck to find some other high ROE non-VMS businesses\
    in which to invest at attractive prices. I am already casting about for such opportunities. If we don’t find\
    attractive sectors in which to invest, then we’ll return our FCF to our investors. ")

    st.write("2017: In my letter last year, I explained \
    that we sometimes buy shrinking businesses, and despite the shrinkage, we still expect to generate good \
    returns on those investments. Growing businesses are more attractive to us, but we can't always acquire \
    enough growing businesses at reasonable prices to invest all of our FCF. Our 'next best' use of capital is \
    acquiring shrinking VMS businesses which still meet or exceed our hurdle rate")

    st.write("The internal execution issues upon which we currently focus are: Maintaining investment discipline,\
    avoiding overhead creep, and increasing our investment in growth, both organic and acquired.")

    st.write("An investment only becomes a lesson if we diligently track its post-acquisition performance and take the \
    time to analyse the outcome while the investment is still fresh in everyone’s mind. We have a process for\
    this that we call a post-acquisition review, or “PAR”. We try to schedule the PAR’s about a year after the\
    initial investment. The PAR’s originated as a head office led process approximately four years ago. Just\
    over a year ago, we started delegating them down to the Operating Groups.")

    st.write("One of the useful things that head office can do, is pilot new processes and champion new ideas. If the \
    ideas add enough value to the BU’s and Operating Groups, and they choose to maintain them, then I’m\
    delighted. Nevertheless, I think all processes should be periodically re-examined for their cost and\
    benefit. An ad-hoc analysis done to understand a problem or opportunity is more likely to translate into\
    action than a quarterly report that gets generated because “we’ve always done it that way”. The former\
    requires curiosity and intelligence, the latter bureaucracy and compliance. If the Operating Groups can\
    learn from their acquisitions by some less burdensome method than PAR’s, I’m all for it.")

    st.write("Overhead creep is a short-term concern of mine and the BU Managers")
    st.write("The only way we’ve been able to consistently stifle overhead growth at head office is to arbitrarily limit\
    headcount additions. That has allowed us to reduce the head office burden from 3.0% of Net Revenue in\
    2004, to 0.5% last year. We hope it will be lower in 2017.")

    st.write("I have struggled to find a less arbitrary means of appropriately sizing overheads. A couple of years ago,\
    our head office tax folks seemed to have an insatiable appetite for increased headcount. I couldn’t argue\
    with their justification, but I asked them to start billing the Operating Groups for the incremental services,\
    separate from our normal overhead allocation. There were two short-term results… our head office tax\
    people hated billing the Operating Groups and justifying their bills, and one of the Operating Groups went\
    off and hired their own tax person. The long-term result also pleased me: the head office tax people have\
    stopped asking about hiring additional staff. Now, if I could just figure out how to stop them spending all\
    that money with outside tax consultants…")

    st.write("I believe that optimising organic growth investment is the single toughest management task in software.\
    It requires a long-term orientation and an intimate understanding of customers and capabilities from our\
    BU Managers")
    st.write("Historically, organic growth has not been a struggle for our best BU Managers. When\
    most of our current Operating Group Managers ran single BU’s, they had strong organic growth\
    businesses. As those managers gave up their original BU management position to oversee a larger Group\
    of BU’s (i.e. became Portfolio Managers), the organic growth of their original BU’s decreased and the\
    profitability of those BU’s increased. Perhaps those trade-offs were rational and inevitable, and it was\
    just a function of maturing verticals and higher market share. Nevertheless, once you’ve experienced\
    higher organic growth with all of its ancillary benefits for employees and for the depth and radius of your\
    business moat, the move towards higher profit and lower growth is much less satisfying. Across the\
    board, our Operating Group Managers have organic growth as the primary objective for their BU\
    Managers.")

    st.write("CSI's strategy is to be a good owner of hundreds (and perhaps someday thousands) of growing\
    autonomous small businesses that generate high returns on capital. Our strategy is unusual. Most CEO's\
    of public companies would rather run a single big business - perhaps two or three big businesses, but\
    rarely 200 businesses. They expect (or hope) to get above average returns on capital by pursuing economies of scale and \
    by crushing or acquiring their smaller competition. 'We are #1 in this large and\
    growing market' is their normal aspirational paradigm. It's also a formula with which shareholders,\
    analysts and boards are comfortable. We recognise that economies of scale, centralised management and\
    world class talent competing in large and growing markets can be a great business-building formula. But,\
    it isn't what we do.")

    st.write("We seek out vertical market software businesses where motivated small teams composed of good people,   \
    can produce superior results in tiny markets. These markets are usually characterised by a gradually\
    consolidating customer base, so partnering with the right clients, and helping them survive and prosper is\
    an important part of our job. What we offer our BU Managers is autonomy, an environment that supports\
    them in mastering vertical market software management skills, and the chance to build an enduring and\
    competent team in a “human-scale” business.")



    st.write("While we have developed some techniques and best practices for fostering organic growth, I think our\
    most powerful tool is using human-scale BU’s.")
    st.write("Priorities are clear, systems haven't had\
    time to metastasise, rules are few, trust and communication are high, and the focus tends to be on how to\
    increase the size of the pie, not how it gets divided. That's how I remember my favourite venture\
    investments when I was a venture capitalist, and it's how I remember many of the early CSI acquisitions.\
    That structure usually suffices until there are perhaps 30 to 40 people in the business.")

    st.write("The larger a business gets, the more difficult it becomes to manage and the more policies, procedures,\
    systems, rules and regulations are generated to handle the growing complexity. Talented people get\
    frustrated, innovation suffers, and the focus shifts from customers and markets to internal communication,\
    cost control, and rule enforcement. The quirky but talented rarely survive in this environment. A huge\
    body of academic research confirms that complexity and co-ordination effort increase at a much faster\
    rate than headcount in a growing organisation.")
    
    st.write("If the BU is small enough, and has a competent BU manager who has several years experience in the\
    vertical, and good functional managers, then he/she will be able to cope with complexity for a while,\
    making the right calls to optimise organic growth as the business grows. The challenge of running a BU\
    of this size is human-scaled. As a BU becomes larger (by our standards, that’s greater than 100\
    employees), I worry that even an extraordinarily brilliant and energetic manager, who has been in the\
    vertical and the BU for a very long time, and is surrounded by a strong team that he/she has selected and\
    trained and winnowed over many years, is going to struggle to steer the business to above industryaverage organic growth.")
    
    st.write("No one wants to admit that they’ve hit their limit. Some BU Managers lack the humility, some lack the\
    courage, and most lack the time for reflection, to notice that their task is getting too large, and the\
    sacrifices are getting too great.")

    st.write("This dividing of larger BU’s into smaller units is rare, but not unknown, in other large companies. One of\
    the HPC’s that we studied was Illinois Tool Works Inc. (“ITW”). It has hundreds of BU’s. We began\
    following the company from afar in 2005.I’m\
    sorry I didn’t reach out to some of the ITW employees and ex-employees until 2015. When I did talk\
    with one of the senior managers, he said (I’m paraphrasing) “Something wonderful happens when you\
    spin off a new business unit.” … “With a clean sheet of paper, the leader only takes those he needs. They\
    set up in an open office with good communication and no overheads. They cover for each other. They\
    leave all the bureaucracy and the crap behind”. I did record a couple of verbatim quotes from that\
    conversation: 'Don't share sales, R&D, HR, etc. because the accountants never get the allocations right\
    and the business units always treat the allocated costs as outside their control', and 'When you get big\
    you lose entrepreneurship'")

    st.write("I don’t want to give you the impression that the 'human-scale' BU idea is a universally accepted doctrine\
    in our ranks. For that, I suspect we’d need more compelling data. However, we have been successfully\
    experimenting with the concept for a long time.Harris has very successfully acquired multiple BU's in the same industry\
    and run them independently rather than combining them into one BU. Both tactics forego obvious and\
    easily obtainable benefits from economies of scale. We think we get something valuable when we\
    constrain BU headcount, but it isn’t a panacea for all of our organic growth challenges.")
    
    st.write("This sort of career path obviously worked for our current Operating Group Managers, who all either came\
    up through the ranks or joined us via an acquisition. I believe that attracting, developing, and keeping\
    that sort of talent, is the internal execution issue that poses the greatest threat to our continued success.")
    st.write("Some businesses get their unique advantage from government-granted monopolies, some from natural\
        resources, some from large patent portfolios, and some from enormous fixed assets. CSI doesn’t have\
        these advantages. Our employees, and the customer relationships that those employees have built and\
        fostered over many years, provide our competitive advantage.")
